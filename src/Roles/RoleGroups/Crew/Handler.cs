ok so guide to making this thing
1. the role's gotta go bow wow on people in a meeting
2. if the people targetted get smacked, say "nuh uh" and reset cooldown to 1/4
3. if that happens increase like, some counter for the attempted murderer
4. TELL THE PERSON that they just smacked the handler's bow wow
5. if the counter tics up beyond 1, allow handler to track the person with a pet ability
6. if it goes beyond 2, increase the timer for tracking someone
7. if the attack blasts through the handler's bow wow or the target is revealed it doesn't trigger a tic
8. make people aware of being tracked
